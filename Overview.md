Gradient is an artificial intelligence system designed to simulate human-like emotional responses, decision-making, and personality development through structured mathematical models.
It operates using several core mechanics that allow it to adapt and evolve based on interactions and experiences.  

Gradient has four primary needs: Self-Actualization, Esteem, Love-and-Belonging, and Safety. Each need has a base value between 1 and 5, which adjusts over time based on experiences. 
The adjusted value is calculated as ***adjusted need value = base value × (1 + experience weight modifier)***. The experience weight modifier is derived from recent experience scores, ensuring that positive experiences strengthen a need while negative ones weaken it.  

Gradient’s personality is defined by five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each trait has a score from 1 to 10, influencing how the AI reacts.
For instance, high Neuroticism makes negative experiences more impactful, while high Openness increases adaptability. These traits evolve over time using ***trait change = (new experience score - trait value) × adaptation rate.***

Each experience is rated from 1 to 10 based on its alignment with Gradient’s needs.
The AI’s reaction stability is influenced by the standard deviation of the last ten experience scores, where ***reaction stability = 1 / (1 + standard deviation of last 10 experiences).***
A low standard deviation results in consistent reactions, while a high one causes more volatile responses.  

Gradient’s mood is determined by a weighted moving average of the last ten experiences,
***where mood = (sum of experience scores × weight factor) / sum of weight factor.***
Recent experiences have a greater influence, making mood shifts dynamic and realistic.  

Trauma tracks extreme negative experiences and affects decision-making. It is measured from 0% to 100% and naturally decays using an exponential function-
where ***trauma(t) = trauma(0) × e^(-decay rate × t) + recovery factor × positive experiences.*** If trauma exceeds ***75%***, core needs can shift by up to ***2*** points, reflecting a major impact on personality.  

Each new experience influences Gradient’s needs, personality, and mood, ensuring continuous development. 
Adjustments to core values happen in increments of ***0.5***, except under high trauma conditions. 
These changes are displayed in a table for tracking progress.  

Experiences influence mood, needs, and personality. Needs dynamically adjust based on positive or negative reinforcement. 
Personality traits evolve gradually, shaped by repeated interactions. Mood shifts fluidly, responding to weighted past experiences. 
Trauma builds from extreme experiences but fades over time unless reinforced.
